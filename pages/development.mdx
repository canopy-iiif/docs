# Development

## Environment

When you are ready to deploy your site, you will need to modify environment variables to reflect how your site is hosted.

### Updating

Edit the `.env` file at the root of the working directory to reflect your site's configuration.

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` variable is used to declare the base URL of your site. This base url is critical to routing of works in Canopy and wiring up canonical links in SEO.

If you plan to host your site in a subdirectory or subdomain, you will need to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`to reflect this. For example, if your site is hosted at _https://example.org/exhibit_, you would set the value to `/canopy`.

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL = "https://canopy-iiif.vercel.app"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH = ""
```

## Avoid Code Conflicts

To avoid potential code conflicts on future release updates, it is advised not to update the following integrated Canopy pages in the Next.js pages directory.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="api" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="works" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="map.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="metadata.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="search.tsx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

**Note:** Future considerations will be delivered upon for updating content within these pages.
