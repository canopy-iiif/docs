## Use Case

You are seeking to quickly try out or demonstrate Canopy IIIF and do not want to install it locally or be concerned with a developer environment.

## Implementation

<Steps>

### Create a StackBlitz instance

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/canopy-iiif/canopy-iiif)

Click on the button above, "Open in StackBlitz". This will open a new browser tab and load the Canopy project in StackBlitz.

<Callout>
  There may be CORS issues rendering images in Safari and Firefox browsers. If
  you're experiencing broken images, please try Chrome or Brave browsers.

</Box>

### Customize Canopy Collection

If you'd like to jump right into customizing or tinkering with config settings, re-name `/config/canopy.sample.json` to `/config/canopy.json`. This will override default config settings and point Canopy to your custom values.

<Callout type="info">
  You may experience StackBlitz resource limits experimenting with larger
  Collections. Prefer small-ish Collections where possible in this environment.
</Callout>

We'll use an example [Late 19th Century Bicycle Parts Catlog](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/collections/cd92fb8d-76a7-4e72-be0f-78a5839caa89)
Collection, provided as a [IIIF Collection](https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/search?query=collection.id:%22cd92fb8d-76a7-4e72-be0f-78a5839caa89%22&as=iiif).

- **Create** a file named `config/canopy.json`.
- **Copy** the below configuration into the file.
- **Save** the configuration file.

```json copy filename="config/canopy.json"
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/search?query=collection.id:%22cd92fb8d-76a7-4e72-be0f-78a5839caa89%22&as=iiif",
  "featured": [
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0142e6bc-21f6-4590-94fb-d35f00b45342?as=iiif"
  ],
  "metadata": ["Date", "Subject", "Notes"]
}
```

To view `config/canopy.json` changes, you'll need to re-build the app. Near the bottom of your StackBlitz screen, you'll see a **Terminal** window.

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![custom stackblitz instance](/examples/stackblitz-custom.png)
</Box>

1. Click into the StackBlitz **Terminal**
2. Quit the dev server `ctrl + c`.
3. Re-start the dev server `npm run dev`.

### Customize Other Options

You now have a starting point to customize other options. For example, you can now experiment further with the [Customize the Search Index](/customize-the-search-index) guide.
