## Use Case

You are seeking to quickly try out or demonstrate Canopy IIIF and do not want to install it locally or be concerned with a developer environment.

## Implementation

<Steps>

### Create a StackBlitz instance

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/canopy-iiif/canopy-iiif)

Click on the button above, "Open in StackBlitz". This will open a new browser tab and load the Canopy project in StackBlitz.

<Callout>
  There may be CORS issues rendering images in Safari and Firefox browsers. If
  you're experiencing broken images, please try Chrome or Brave browsers.
</Callout>

### Customize Canopy Collection

If you'd like to jump right into customizing or tinkering with config settings, try re-naming `/config/canopy.sample.json` to `/config/canopy.json`. This will override the default config settings and allow you to experiment with your own settings.

<Callout type="info">
  When demoing in StackBlitz, your are in `dev` mode when configuring
  `/config/canopy.json`. This means that you can use the `dev` settings to
  target a IIIF Collection or Manifest.
</Callout>

For example, let's use the [Athletic Department Football Films](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?collection=Athletic%20Department%20Football%20Films) collection provided by Northwestern University.

- **Create** a file named `config/canopy.json`.
- **Copy** the below configuration into the file.
- **Save** the configuration file.

```json filename="config/canopy.json"
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/8cdf83c9-3831-4211-acd7-122bca9b89da?as=iiif&size=200",
  "metadata": ["Date", "Subject"]
}
```

After making any configuration changes, your dev server will automatically re-build and re-load the app. You can see the dev server status in the StackBlitz Terminal.

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![custom stackblitz instance](/examples/stackblitz-custom.png)
</Box>

Click into the Terminal and quit the dev server by pressing `ctrl + c`. Then, re-start the dev server by running `npm run dev`.

### Customize Other Options

You now have a starting point to customize other options. For example, you can now experiment further with the [Customize the Search Index](/customize-the-search-index) guide.
