### Map

A map route can be enabled to provide geographic discovery of works via `config/options.json`. This feature builds markers off of geographic point features found in [navPlace](https://iiif.io/api/extension/navplace/) properties at the Manifest level. To enable this option, set the option to `true`.

**Note:** Currently, only `navPlace` properties found at the Manifest level are displayed. Also, onlyFeatures of type: "Point" are displayed.

```json
"map": { "enabled": true }
```

The map's tile layers are also configured here, giving users the ability to choose and customize layers for their project. Additional services, such as MapBox, can be easily integrated following this pattern. Each tile layer defined here will appear as an option in the layer control of the map. The name property defines the text next to the radio button. The url property is the link to the tile layer. Finally, the attribution property defines the text that appears at the bottom of the map in case the tile layer requires any specific attribution on use. The first tile layer in the array will be used as the default map.

```json
"tileLayers": [
  {
    "name": "OpenStreetMap",
    "url": "https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
    "attribution": "&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors"
  },
  {
    "name": "OpenTopoMap",
    "url": "https://{s}.tile.opentopomap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png",
    "attribution": "&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors"
  }
]
```
