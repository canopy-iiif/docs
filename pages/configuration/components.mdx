# Components Configuration

The `components` property is optional and provides a way to customize components used within a Canopy IIIF project.

## Viewer

The `viewer` property is used to specify the default viewer for your Canopy IIIF project. The viewer is responsible for rendering IIIF Manifests to `work/*` routes. Canopy IIIF currently supports two viewers: Clover and Ramp.

### Clover IIIF

The default viewer is [Clover IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/), which is a lightweight, fast, and responsive image viewer. It is designed to work with IIIF images, video, and audio, and provides a simple interface interacting with IIIF Manifests. Explicitly setting the viewer to Clover is optional behavior and does not require any additional configuration.

```json filename="config/canopy.json" copy {3-5}
{
  "collection": "https://example.org/iiif/collection.json",
  "components": {
    "viewer": "clover"
  }
}
```

### Ramp

[Ramp](https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/) is an A/V focused viewer that is designed to work with media, annotations, structured navigation, and transcripts associated with a IIIF Manifests.

```json filename="config/canopy.json" copy {3-5}
{
  "collection": "https://example.org/iiif/collection.json",
  "components": {
    "viewer": "ramp"
  }
}
```
