# Basic Canopy IIIF Configuration

## Configuration Properties

Both the prod and dev environments have a configuration. These configurations can match each other; however in some cases, development speed can be aided by targeting a smaller IIIF Collection id as a fixture.

```json
{
  "prod": {
    "label": { "none": ["Hobhouse"] },
    "summary": { "none": ["Manuscripts from the archive of Emily Hobhouse."] },
    "collection": "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/collection/hobhouse",
    "featured": [
      "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/8da97e8c-4e12-457d-aad8-3327b3aec183.json",
      "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/2968d5c7-3718-44ef-92ea-ee4cc58cc677.json"
    ],
    "metadata": ["Extent", "Title", "Date Statement", "Language"]
  },
  "dev": {
    "label": { "none": ["Hobhouse"] },
    "summary": { "none": ["Manuscripts from the archive of Emily Hobhouse."] },
    "collection": "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/collection/hobhouse",
    "featured": [
      "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/8da97e8c-4e12-457d-aad8-3327b3aec183.json",
      "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/manifest/2968d5c7-3718-44ef-92ea-ee4cc58cc677.json"
    ],
    "metadata": ["Extent", "Title", "Date Statement", "Language"]
  }
}
```

## Collection

The `collection` property is required and must be the id of the referenced source IIIF Collection. Collections of Collections are not currently supported.

```json
{
  "collection": "https://iiif.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/iiif/collection/hobhouse"
}
```

### Site Title and Description

The Canopy IIIF site title and description are respectively the `label` and `summary` of the set Collection resource. You can optionally override this by providing a valid Presentation 3.0 [label](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#label) and/or [summary](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#summary) property.

```json
{
  "label": { "none": ["Hobhouse"] },
  "summary": { "none": ["Manuscripts from the archive of Emily Hobhouse."] }
}
```
