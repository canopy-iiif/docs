# Metadata and Facets

Curating Metadata allows implementers of Canopy IIIF to select metadata labels that provide use to end users. An optimal case is a label common to all or most manifests with some in diversity of values across those resources. Metadata labels that are curated will be automatically included as featured elements on the homepage, the metadata page, linking from works, and as facets on the search page.

**Note:** Metadata labels are not yet BCP 47 language code aware; however, aggregation processes will make exact string comparisons regardless of language code.

```json
"metadata": ["Extent", "Title", "Date Statement", "Language"]
```
