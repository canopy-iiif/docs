# Locale Preferences

Canopy IIIF supports locale preferences for user interface language. The default configuration language is English; however, additional languages can be defined. For more information, [see Locale](#locale).

```json copy
"locales": [
  {
    "config": "locales/en.json",
    "label": "English",
    "lang": "en"
  }
]
```

## Customizing a Locale

User interface language strings are set through a locale configuration file located in the `config/locales` directory. Persons customizing a Canopy instance can add new language configurations to support their preferred locales. We welcome all pull requests to add new locales to the Canopy IIIF project.

_English_ configuration is predefined and found at `config/locales/en.json`

```json filename="config/locales/en.json" copy
{
  "footerSourceCollection": "Source Collection",
  "footerToggleTheme": "Toggle Theme",
  "homepageHighlightedWorks": "Highlighted Works",
  "searchButton": "Search",
  "searchResults": "Results",
  "searchFilter": "Filter",
  "searchFilterAny": "Any",
  "searchFilterClear": "Clear All",
  "searchFilterClose": "Close",
  "searchFilterSubmit": "View Results"
}
```

## Multiple Locales

If _more than one_ locale is defined in the `config/options.json`, a select element will render in the header allowing users to toggle the defined languages. In addition, Canopy will attempt to align the language set by the user's browser with the available options. As a fallback, the first locale defined in the array will be set.

As an example, if a visitor with `en-US` visited a Canopy instance that included both `no` and `en` as language options, the `en` locale configuration would be the default locale. Whereas, if a user visited this same instance with `fr` as their browser language, the default locale would be the `no` configuration.

```json copy
"locales": [
  {
    "config": "locales/no.json",
    "label": "Norsk",
    "lang": "no"
  },
  {
    "config": "locales/en.json",
    "label": "English",
    "lang": "en"
  }
]
```
