# Deploy to GitHub Pages

<Section size="1">
  <Text size="4">
    Canopy IIIF is designed to be deployed as a statically generated website.
    Static sites are a great option for many projects, as they are fast, secure,
    and easy to deploy and maintain. This guide will walk you through the
    process of deploying project as a static website using GitHub Pages using
    the incorporated GitHub Actions in Canopy to automate the build and
    deployment process.

## Use Case

    You are a graduate student researching the American painter Beauford Delaney
    and you would like to easily create and host a digital scholarship project
    analyzing items in your institution's digital collections.

## Implementation

<Steps>

### Create your template repository

- Navigate to the [Canopy IIIF](https://github.com/canopy-iiif/canopy-iiif) repository
- Click the **Use this template** dropdown and then select **Create a new repository**
- Under **Owner**, select the GitHub account or organization (if applicable) that you want to own the repository
- Enter a **Repository name** for your new Canopy IIIF project, ex: `delaney-project`
- Click the **Create repository** button

![create new repository from use template](/examples/use-template.png)

### Adjust workflow permissons

- Once the repository is created, open the **Settings** tab
- Open the **Actions** dropdown under _Code and automation_ and select **General** .
- Select **Read and write permissions** option under _Workflow permissions_ and **Save**. This allows the GitHub
  workflow to run and the static Canopy output to be deployed to a new branch.

### Modify environmmental variables

- Next, find the `.env` file in your repository and open it for editing
- Modify `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` to reflect your GitHub username, ex: `https://markpbaggett.github.io`
- Modify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` to reflect the name of your new repository , ex: `/delaney-project`
- Commit the changed `.env` file

The `.env` file should follow a format similar to the following:

```sh filename=".env" copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="https://{GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="/{GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME}"
```

In this example, we are using the GitHub username `markpbaggett` and the repository name `delaney-project`.

```sh filename=".env" copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="https://markpbaggett.github.io"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="/delaney-project"
```

After committing the new `.env` file, a GitHub workflow will run. Once the action has run successfully, the action indicator should update to a check mark and a new branch **gh-pages** will be created with an output of your static site.

### Watch the build

- Once the **gh-pages** branch exists, press the **Settings** tab
- Under _Code and automation_, press **Pages**
- In the _Build and deployment_ section, select **gh-pages** from the **Branch** dropdown
- Leave `/(root)` set from the **Folder** dropdown
- Click **Save**

![Set gh-pages in Settings](/examples/set-gh-pages.png)

### Validate the URL

<Callout type="info">
  **Tip**: Find the URL in the GitHub **Settings** tab, by viewing **Pages**
  under _Code and automation_.
</Callout>

Now your Canopy site will be active at a URL derived from values you defined in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` settings.

```sh
https://[NEXT_PUBLIC_URL][NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH]
```

The example values above would result in the following URL:

```sh
https://markpbaggett.github.io/delaney-project
```

</Steps>
