## Front Matter

At the top of each Markdown file, you can add front matter to provide additional information about the page. Front matter is written in YAML, and must be surrounded by `---` on either side.

```mdx
---
title: "Title in Front Matter"
---
```

### Content Pages

All new content pages created in the `content` directory can have the following front matter:

#### title

The title of the page. This will be used in the HTML `<title>` and associated `<meta>` tags.

#### navigation

The navigation menu for the page. This should be the relative directory path for the page. For example, if the page is in `content/correspondence/`, the navigation should be `correspondence`.

#### referencedManifests

A list of IIIF Manifests URIs that are referenced in the content of the page. These Manifests MUST be a part of source IIIF Collection used for your Canopy project. These will create a link between the `/work` page and the current content page.

```mdx
---
title: "January 1955 Correspondence"
navigation: "correspondence"
referencedManifests:
  - https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/46de2c91-3a29-4525-939e-ee17073f3a7e?as=iiif

### Home Page

The home page at `content/index.mdx` is a special content page with distinct front matter keys in addition to `title`.

#### showHero

#### showHighlighted
