## Primary Navigation

Canopy IIIF creates it's primary navigation at build time from `/content/_meta_.json`. Each link will have a `path` and `text` key. A `path` value will resolve to a file or directory under `/content` or `/src/pages`. The `text` key will be what's displayed in the navigation bar. The order of the links in the array will be the order they appear in the navigation.

```json filename="/content/_meta_.json"
[
  {
    "path": "/works",
    "text": "Works"
  },
  {
    "path": "/metadata",
    "text": "Metadata"
  },
  {
    "path": "/about",
    "text": "About"
  }
]
```

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![canopy home page](/examples/content-navigation-primary.png)
</Box>

<Callout type="info">
  Canopy IIIF provides the **Works** and **Metadata** pages out of the box,
  pre-configured. Therefore you will not see markdown files for these pages
  under the `/content` directory, though their links will resolve.
</Callout>

For a more detailed explanation of how the `path` value is resolved, see below.

<Callout>
  **Technical explanation**: The `path` value follows the
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts)
  `pages` routing convention. The `path` value `/works` will map to
  `/src/pages/works/index.tsx`. The `path` value`/metadata` will map to
  `/src/pages/metadata.tsx`.
</Callout>

### Custom Content

Most users will want to add navigation for custom content to their site. For example, a user may want to customize the navigation on the **About** page to better fit the content of their site or create a brand new page with custom navigation. This is done by creating a markdown file under `/content` and adding a link to the primary navigation (as seen above).

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="example.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

For example, to add a page called **Essays** to the primary navigation, create a markdown file called `index.mdx` under `/content/essays`.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="content" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="example.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="essays" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.json" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="page1.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="page2.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout type="info">
  If creating a new page, try copying the content from `src/pages/about` into
  `src/pages/{your_page_name}`. This will give you a good starting point for
  your new page.
</Callout>

## Secondary Navigation

### Top Level

Secondary navigation may be defined from within a `_meta.json` file located within a subdirectory of `/content`. For example, secondary navigation within **About** might look like this:

```json filename="/content/about/_meta_.json"
[
  {
    "path": "/about",
    "text": "About"
  },
  {
    "path": "/about/example",
    "text": "Markdown Example"
  }
]
```

Which will render _top-level_ secondary navigation links **About** and **Markdown Example**:

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![canopy home page](/examples/content-navigation-secondary.png)
</Box>

These **About** secondary navigation links are wired up to route to the corresponding markdown file. For example, clicking on **Markdown Example** will route to `/content/about/example`.

**Markdown Example** must also define a `navigation` frontmatter property, identifying it's parent. This is used to render the _top-level_ secondary navigation links. For example, the **Markdown Example** markdown file might look like this:

```markdown filename="/content/about/example.mdx" {3}
---
title: About
navigation: "about"
---

Content goes here
```

### Internal Page Navigation

Internal page navigation links (ie. "Use Cases", "Features", and "Colophon") are automatically generated for _heading level 2_ elements (`## Heading`) in your Markdown content. For example, the About page might look like this:

```markdown filename="/content/about/index.mdx"
# About

Using a single [IIIF Presentation Collection](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#overview-collection) as a data source, Canopy IIIF (Canopy) generates a browseable, searchable, customizable, and contextually-driven static site using Next.js without duplicating content.

## Use Cases

Some content here

## Features

Some content here

## Colophon

Some content here
