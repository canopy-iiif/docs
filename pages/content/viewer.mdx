# Viewer

When creating content for Canopy, you can use the `Viewer` component to embed a deep-zoom and A/V capable IIIF Viewer into your content. The integrated IIIF Viewer is the [Clover IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) Viewer component

## Properties

| Property    | Type   | Required | Description                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| iiifContent | string | true     | IIIF Manifest or Collection URI to be rendered. |

- This resource may OR may not be part of the IIIF Collection used in your Canopy project.
- The `Viewer` will render both IIIF Manifests and IIIF Collections.

## Usage

```mdx copy
<Viewer iiifContent="https://manifests.collections.yale.edu/ycba/obj/702" />
```
