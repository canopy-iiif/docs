# Slider

`Slider` is a component that renders a Collection as a carousel component. Each item in the referenced IIIF Collection is rendered as an HTML `figure`, the `thumbnail` and a `figcaption` containing the `label` of the Manifest. Use rendered figure will link to `/work` page for the relative Manifest.

## Properties

| Property      | Type     | Required | Description                         |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `iiifContent` | `string` | `true`   | IIIF Collection URI to be rendered. |

- This resource may OR may not be part of the IIIF Collection used in your Canopy project.
- If the Collection is generated by Canopy, the `homepage` routes will automatically link to respective `/work` pages and `/search` facets.

## Usage

```mdx copy
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/creator/david-alfaro-siqueiros " />
```
