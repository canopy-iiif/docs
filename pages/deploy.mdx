That means that Canopy IIIF is designed to be deployed as a statically generated website. This is a great option for many projects, as it is fast, secure, and easy to deploy. However, if your project requires server-side components (e.g., [API routing](/api-routes)), Canopy can be deployed to any Next.js capable hosting service.
