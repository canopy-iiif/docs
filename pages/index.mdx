      What is Canopy IIIF?
    </Heading>

    <Text size="4" weight="light">
      **Canopy** is an open source site generator built with
      [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) and Next.js. Using a [IIIF
      Collection](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#51-collection) as a data
      source, Canopy IIIF generates a browseable and searchable static site and
      provides a straightforward solution using Markdown for adding scholary context
      to the resources that are referenced.

      Features
    </Heading>
    <Text size="4" weight="light">
      Canopy IIIF extends the features of Next.js to produce a full-text search
      index using FlexSearch, provides support for both IIIF Presentation API
      2.x and 3.0 specifications, and automatically generates facets based on
      the curated metadata labels and values found within Manifests. The
      platformâ€™s API routes return IIIF collections and allow for users to
      reference IIIF resources internally and externally. In addition to these
      features, the product roadmap and planned features include expanding
      internationalization support, generating interactive maps and timelines
      based on the presence of navPlace and navDate properties, and leveraging
      IIIF Content State and Change Discovery APIs.
