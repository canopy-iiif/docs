### What is Canopy?

**Canopy IIIF** is an open source site generator built with [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) and Next.js. Using a [IIIF Collection](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#51-collection) as a data source, Canopy IIIF generates a browseable and searchable static site and provides a straightforward solution using Markdown for adding scholary context to the resources that are referenced.

### Use Cases

<Box>
    #### Exhibits

    Libraries, museums, and archives can create digital exhibits from the works in their repositories

</Box>
<Box>
    #### Minimal infrastructure

    Small-scale, headless infrastructure for institutions with limited resources to build their own digital collections application

</Box>
</Flex>

### Features

Canopy IIIF extends the features of Next.js to produce a full-text search index using FlexSearch, provides support for both IIIF Presentation API 2.x and 3.0 specifications, and automatically generates facets based on the curated metadata labels and values found within Manifests. The platformâ€™s API routes return IIIF collections and allow for users to reference IIIF resources internally and externally. In addition to these features, the product roadmap and planned features include expanding internationalization support, generating interactive maps and timelines based on the presence of navPlace and navDate properties, and leveraging IIIF Content State and Change Discovery APIs.
