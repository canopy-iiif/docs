# Home

The Canopy IIIF build process automatically generates a home page for your collection.

## Hero Image

Using the `featured` property in your collection's `config/canophy.json` file, a hero image is created for your
collection automatically.

```json file=config/canopy.json {4-7}
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/search?query=%22nez%20perce%22&as=iiif&size=125",
  "metadata": ["Subject", "Date", "Dimensions"],
  "featured": [
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/cd5e1b9c-370b-40e5-b3d9-defc1d8e0777?as=iiif",
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif"
  ]
}
```

If the `featured` array contains more than one Manifest, the hero image will be a slideshow with arrows pointing left
and right that allows visitors to browse featured works. In the bottom right corner of the hero image, the label of the
Manifest is displayed as the title of the work.

If no `featured` Manifests are provided in `config/canopy.json`, the hero image will be randomly selected from the
Manifests within the collection.

## Highlighted Works

At the bottom of the home page, highlighted works sliders are displayed. These sliders are generated based on the values
of the `metadata` array in `config/canopy.json`.

```json file=config/canopy.json {3}
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/search?query=%22nez%20perce%22&as=iiif&size=125",
  "metadata": ["Subject", "Date", "Dimensions"],
  "featured": [
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/cd5e1b9c-370b-40e5-b3d9-defc1d8e0777?as=iiif",
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/14a6aa15-9e12-47a7-9617-91f430d4f47b?as=iiif"
  ]
}
```

The sliders are driven by IIIF Collections that are automatically generated during the build process. At this time,
a IIIF Collection resource is created for each unique metadata value in the Manifests of the IIIF Collection that is
associated with a label in the `metadata` array of `config/canopy.json`. The generated IIIF Collections contain each
Manifest that has the value for the associated metadata label.

On the home, a slider is created for each value in the `metadata` array of `confing/canopy.json`. The IIIF Collection
that is passed to each slider is randomly selected during build time.
