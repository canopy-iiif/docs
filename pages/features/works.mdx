# Works

For each Manifest in your source IIIF Colllection, Canopy automatically generates a unique route that serves as the work page for that item as `/works/${slugified-manifest-label}`. The contents of the Manifest are parsed and utilized to automatically generate all the features of the work page.

<Callout type="info">
  If the label of the Manifest is not unique, Canopy will append a unique identifier to the end of the slug to ensure each work page has a unique route.
</Callout>

## Features

The work page is composed of several features that are generated automatically based on the contents of the Manifest:

- [IIIF Viewer](#iiif-viewer)
- [Metadata and Required Statements](#metadata-and-required-statements)
- [Referenced Content](#referenced-content)
- [Related Works](#related-works)

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![canopy work page](/examples/creating-markdown-content-referenced-item-2.png)
</Box>

### IIIF Viewer

At the top of the work page is a IIIF [Viewer](/content/viewer). Currently, Canopy leverages the [Clover IIIF Viewer component](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) to display deep zoomable images, A/V resources, and multi-canvased works. The original IIIF Manifest that the work page is generated from is passed to Clover so that it can display the work accordingly.

```jsx
<Viewer iiifContent="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/19efac1e-5e79-471c-89c2-a60a775562ce?as=iiif" />
```

### Metadata and Required Statements

Descriptive properties from the IIIF Manifest are displayed directly underneath the viewer.

The `label` of the Manifest is displayed prominently as the title of the work.

```json filename="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/19efac1e-5e79-471c-89c2-a60a775562ce?as=iiif" {5}
{
  ...
  "label": {
      "none": [
        "Raven Blanket - Nez Percé"
      ]
    },
  ...
}
```

If a `summary` is present in the Manifest, its values are displayed as the work's description.

```json filename="https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/19efac1e-5e79-471c-89c2-a60a775562ce?as=iiif" {5}
{
  ...
  "summary": {
      "none": [
        "written, illustrated, and published by Edward S. Curtis ; edited by Frederick Webb Hodge ; foreword by Theodore Roosevelt ; field research conducted under the patronage of J. Pierpont Morgan. ; Original photogravures produced in Boston by John Andrew & Son from 1899-1910."
      ]
  },
  ...
}
```

Next, each JSON object in the `metadata` and `requiredStatement` properties of the Manifest are displayed in a list of definitions.
If the metadata label is listed in the `metadata` property inside the `canopy.json` file, the value will link to search
results of all other works within the collection that also contain the subject and unique value.

```json

  ...

Finally, a link to the IIIF Manifest is displayed so that the item can be easily reused.

### Referenced Content

If the Manifest has been included in a `referencedManifests` section of any custom content page, a link to the custom
content will be generated and displayed in the **Content Referencing This Work** section.

```mdx {5-7}
---
title: "January 1955 Correspondence"
navigation: "correspondence"
referencedManifests:
  - https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/46de2c91-3a29-4525-939e-ee17073f3a7e?as=iiif

### Related Works

Finally, the Related Works sections is displayed. This section is generated automatically by Canopy and is based on the
contents of the `metadata` property in `canopy.json`. For each label, Canopy creates a [Slider](/content/slider)
component based on a random value associated with it in the Manifest's `metadata` property. This label
and value has a corresponding IIIF Collection Manifest that is generated during the build process that includes all
manifests in the collection that have the same label and value.

```mdx
<Slider iiifContent="/api/facet/creator/david-alfaro-siqueiros " />
```
