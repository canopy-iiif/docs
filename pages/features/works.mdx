# Works

Canopy IIIF generates a unique web page for each Manifest in your Collection during the build process.

## Viewer

At the top of the page is the [Viewer component](/content/viewer). Currently, Canopy utilizes the Viewer component
from [Clover IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) to display deep zoomable images and A/V content. The
viewer leverages the IIIF Manifest related to the page to display the content.

## Metadata and Required Statements

Directly underneath the viewer the work's metadata is displayed. This component is generated from several properties
found in the underlying IIIF Manifest. First, the `label` of the Manifest is displayed as the title of the work. Next,
if a `summary` is present in the Manifest, it is displayed as the work's description. Then, each JSON object in the
`metadata` and `requiredStatement` properties of the Manifest are displayed. The strings of the labels are transformed
to definition term elements (`<dt>`) and their associated values are transformed to definition description elements
(`<dd>`). If the metadata label is listed in the `metadata` property inside the `canopy.json` file, the value will be
a hyper link that lists all search results within the collection that also contain the value. Finally, a link to the
IIIF Manifest is displayed so that the item can be easily reused.

## Referenced Component

If the Manifest has been included in a `referencedManifests` section of any custom content page, a link to the custom
content will be generated and displayed in the **Content Referencing This Work** section.

## Related Works

Finally, the Related Works sections is displayed. This section is generated automatically by Canopy and is based on the
contents of the `metadata` property in `canopy.json`. For each value, Canopy creates a [Slider](/content/slider)
component based on a random value associated with the label in the parent Manifest's `metadata` property. This label
and value has a corresponding IIIF Collection Manifest that is generated during the build process that includes all
manifests in the collection that have the same label and value.
