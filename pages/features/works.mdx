# Works

Canopy IIIF automatically generates a unique web page during the build process for each Manifest listed in your
Collection.

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![canopy work page](/examples/creating-markdown-content-referenced-item-2.png)
</Box>

## Viewer

At the top of the work page is the [Viewer](/content/viewer). Currently, Canopy utilizes the viewer component
from [Clover IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) to display deep zoomable images, A/V resources, and
multi-canvased works. The original IIIF Manifest that this page is built from is passed to the viewer for display
instructions.

## Metadata and Required Statements

Descriptive properties from the IIIF Manifest are displayed directly underneath the viewer. First, the `label` of the
Manifest is displayed as the title of the work. Next, if a `summary` is present in the Manifest, it is displayed
prominently as the work's description. Then, each JSON object in the `metadata` and `requiredStatement` properties of
the Manifest are displayed. The string values associated with the labels are transformed to definition term elements
(`<dt>`) and their associated values are transformed to definition description elements (`<dd>`). If the metadata label
is listed in the `metadata` property inside the `canopy.json` file, the value will be a hyper link that lists all search
results within the collection that also contain the value. Finally, a link to the IIIF Manifest is displayed so that the
item can be easily reused.

## Referenced Component

If the Manifest has been included in a `referencedManifests` section of any custom content page, a link to the custom
content will be generated and displayed in the **Content Referencing This Work** section.

## Related Works

Finally, the Related Works sections is displayed. This section is generated automatically by Canopy and is based on the
contents of the `metadata` property in `canopy.json`. For each value, Canopy creates a [Slider](/content/slider)
component based on a random value associated with the label in the parent Manifest's `metadata` property. This label
and value has a corresponding IIIF Collection Manifest that is generated during the build process that includes all
manifests in the collection that have the same label and value.
