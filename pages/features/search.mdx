# Search and Work Results

Canopy IIIF automatically provides a route to all works in a collection at `/works`. This same page is displayed when
a user searches for a term in the search bar at the top of the screen. This page displays thumbnails for all works in
the collection using a masonry layout so that the full thumbnail is displayed within the grid. All works are displayed
from this route and are lazily loaded as the user scrolls down the page.

## Features

The search and work results page is composed of several features that are available automatically:

- Results List
- Filter
