# Metadata

Canopy IIIF provides a Metadata page as an additional access point where users can easily discover all the unique facets
across the collection.

<Box m="9" my="6">
  ![canopy metadata page](/examples/features-metadata-1.png)
</Box>

This page is generated automatically during the build process and is based on the values specified in the `metadata`
property of the `config/canopy.json` file.

```json {3}
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/search?query=%22nez%20perce%22&as=iiif&size=125",
  "metadata": ["Subject", "Date", "Dimensions"],
}
```

The page is organized based on the order of the metadata labels in the array. Below each label is a link to search
results to works in the collection that have that metadata label and a unique value. The values are organized in order
of how many works have that label and value pair in the collection. Clicking the link will take the user to search
results limited to that specific label and value pair.
