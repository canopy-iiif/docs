# Layout

Canopy IIIF leans on a combination of [Radix UI Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/overview) and MDX (Markdown) to provide a flexible design system. All Markdown files with `.mdx` extensions in the `content` directory have access to Radix UI Themes components.

### Radix UI Themes

In addition to Radix UI Themes granting access to customizable Colors, Scaling, and Radius styling, implementers have access to an [accessible component library](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/docs/theme/overview) for building custom layouts.

# Francis Danby

<Section size="2">
  <Flex justify="between">
    <Text size="4" weight="light">
      Born in 1793 near Killinick, Ireland, Francis Danby initially gained recognition for his romantic landscapes and atmospheric scenes that captivated the Victorian public. After moving to Bristol, England, he became a key figure in the Bristol School of artists, where he further developed his unique style of using dramatic contrasts and rich, moody colors to evoke powerful emotions. His work, often imbued with themes of the sublime and picturesque, made significant contributions to the British Romantic movement in art.
