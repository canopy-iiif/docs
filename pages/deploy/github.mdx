Hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) can be done easily
in just a few steps.

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the [Canopy-IIIF](https://github.com/canopy-iiif/canopy-iiif)
repository to create a new repository based on this template. Select "Create a new repository" and choose the GitHub
account or organization you want to copy the contents to from the **Owner** dropdown. Choose a name for your new repository
and entire it in the **Repository name** field. Unless you have a paid GitHub account, select **Public**. Click the
"Create repository" button to create the new repository.

2. Once the repository is created, press the **Settings** button and **Actions** â†’ **General** under *Code and automation*.
Then select **Read and write permissions** under *Workflow permissions* and press **Save**. This allows the GitHub
workflow to run and the static Canopy output to be deployed to a new branch.

3. Next, modify the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.deploy.yml` file in repository for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`
to be relative to the new repository. After changing these settings, commit your change and trigger the action to run.
Once the action has run, the action indicator should change from a *red X* to a *green check mark* and a new branch called
**gh-pages** will be created.

4. Once the **gh-pages** branch exists and the action indicator is a *green check mark*, again press the Settings button.
Under *Code and automation*, click **Pages** and select **gh-pages** from the **Branch** dropdown under *Build and deployment*
and click **Save*. Now your Canopy site will be active at the URL you defined in the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` setting.
