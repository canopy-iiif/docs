### Origination

Canopy was initially conceived at the University of Tennessee Libraries in the Summer '21 as a statically generated web application for the [Rising from the Ashes: The Chimney Tops 2 Wildfires Oral History Project](https://rfta.lib.utk.edu/). This project was generated from a single IIIF Collection; however, the components delivering the user interface became heavily tailored to the source material of the Rising from the Ashes project, thus limiting the reuse of the codebase for other collections. The original Canopy featured a heavily integrated IIIF A/V Viewer designed to deliver Sound and Video resources. This A/V viewer would eventually evolve into a partial inspiration for [Clover IIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/).

Canopy was reimagined as **Canopy IIIF** in early Winter '22 with the primary focus of the project maintaining the the ability to build an interoperable site from <Strong>any</Strong> IIIF Collection following IIIF Presentation API 2.0 and 3.0 specifications.

### Colophon

The project name <Em>"Canopy"</Em> is inspired by the <Strong>tree</Strong> motiff in the presentation, [A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure](https://www.cni.org/topics/standards/a-trees-strength-is-its-trunk-iiif-as-central-operational-infrastructure), delivered by M.A. Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and Esm√© Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting. Following this infrastructure vision, Canopy was created as a front end solution for rapid and easy creation of static sites using a IIIF Collection and its Manifests.

Canopy IIIF is created using [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/), with a [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) index for text search, [IIIF Presentation API 3.0](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/) delivering resource content, [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from [IIIF Commons](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons) and [Samvera](https://samvera.org/) supporting the work presentation and resource delivery.
