# Use RAMP as your Default Viewer

<Section size="1">
  <Text size="4">
    Canopy IIIF comes preconfigured to use either the [CloverIIIF](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif) or
    [RAMP](https://ramp.avalonmediasystem.org/) viewers. This guide will explain how to use RAMP instead of CloverIIIF
    as the viewer for your collections.

<Callout type="info">
    Currently, Canopy has no method of determining the work type of a IIIF work. Since RAMP is designed for Audio Visual
     content only, RAMP should only be used when all of the content is audio or video works.
</Callout>

## Use Case

You are a curator who wants to create a digital exhibit on a collection of audio visual content. The manifests that
represent each work include structures and ranges and you want to be able to display these to your users.

## Implementation

<Steps>

### Modify Config to Use an A/V Collection

Select a IIIF Collection that contains only A/V works and modify your `canopy.json` file to use it.

```json filename="config/canopy.json" copy
{
  "collection": "https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/rfta",
  "metadata": ["Place", "Date", "Subject"]
}
```

### Add a Components Section to Your Config

Add a new components section to your canopy.json file.

```json filename="config/canopy.json" copy {4-6}
{
  "collection": "https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/rfta",
  "metadata": ["Place", "Date", "Subject"]
  "components": {
    "viewer": "ramp"
  }
}
```

### View and Navigate Works in the RAMP Viewer

Once your site has been updated and it is finished rebuilding, navigate to a work to explore it with RAMP.
