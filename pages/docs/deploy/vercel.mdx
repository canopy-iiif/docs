# Vercel

Being a Next.js-based application, Canopy can also be easily hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). To do so, you'll need to create a hobby account
on **Vercel** and link it to your GitHub account. Once you've done that, you can deploy your own copy of Canopy-IIIF to
Vercel by following these steps:

<Steps>

### Import the Repository

After you've logged in to Vercel, click the **Start deploying** button. Then, from the **Let's Build Something New**
screen, click the **Import** button next to the repository you've created.

### Configure

Next, give your repository a name a press **Deploy**. Vercel will then build and deploy your application and make it available at `${YOUR-PROJECT-NAME}.vercel.app`.

### Environment Variables

Finally, edit the `.env` in your repository on Github and make sure that the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` variable and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` variables match your project in Vercel. By default, the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` variable should be
similar to your project name and you should not have to modify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`.
