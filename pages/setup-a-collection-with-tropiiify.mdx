# Set up a Collection with Tropy and Tropiiify

<Section size="1">
  <Text size="4">
    Canopy IIIF generates a browseable and searchable static site for digital collections and exhibits using a
    single IIIF Collection. If you're starting from scratch, you may not have a IIIF Collection, IIIF Manifests,
    or a IIIF Image server online. This guide will walk you through the process of starting from zero and leveraging
    [Tropy](https://tropy.org/), [Tropiiify](https://github.com/arkalab/tropiiify), and GitHub Pages with Canopy to
    deploy a full digital collection site.

    In addition to Canopy, this guide requires a [GitHub account](https://github.com/),
    [Tropy software]((https://tropy.org/)), and the [Tropiiify plugin](https://github.com/arkalab/tropiiify).
    All of these additional requirements are free to use.

## Use Case

  You are a digital scholar with many images on your personal computer that are not available in an existing IIIF
  repository online, and you would like to build a new digital scholarship site with these materials.

## Implementation

<Steps>

### Create a Repository in GitHub to Act as an Image Server

Once we've described and arranged the images for your project, they will need to be hosted in GitHub.
To do this, let's create a new GitHub repository and configure it to serve your images.

* Navigate to [Create New Repository](https://github.com/new).
* Choose the account you want to own your site in the **Owner** dropdown. This is usually yourself.
* Give your repository a name that makes sense for your project. (e.g. *images-for-canopy-project*)
* Make sure to check the radio button next to **Public** so that the images will be publicly available.
* Click **Create Repository**.

### Arrange and Describe your Works in Tropy

Now that you have a place to store your images, we need to arrange them into works and describe those works
so they are meaningful to others. To do this, we are going to use Tropy.

1. Download and install [Tropy](https://tropy.org/) on your computer.
2. Once installed, let's add a few images. If your images are compound works or books, you can arrange them as so. Follow the [Tropy Docs](https://docs.tropy.org/) for more details.
3. As you describe your new works, make sure you use the **Tropy Generic** metadata template so that your metadata gets mapped to the manifest.
4. In the *identifier* field, be sure to use a unique string for each work.

### Export Your Images and Works as IIIF

To get our new works to IIIF, we need to install Tropiiify. This plugin handles a lot of the complex pieces of a Canopy
site including: creating static IIIF image API responses with tiling, splitting the images into Tiles, generating your
manifests, and ultimately a IIIF collection object.

1. Download the latest release of the [plugin](https://github.com/martimpassos/tropiiify/releases/latest).
2. In Tropy, navigate to *Preferences… > Plugins* and click Install Plugin to select the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Configure your IIIF by clicking the *Settings* button in *Preferences > Plugins*.
4. Set the `Name` value to what you want your export action to be called. This value will show up in the *File > Export menu* (e.g. Export IIIF).
5. Set the `Collection Name` to what you want your Canopy project to be called.
6. Set `IIIF base id` to the name of your GitHub Pages site. This will include the repository name and the account you added the repository to like so: `https://{GitHubAccountName}.github.io/{RepositoryName}` (e.g. https://markpbaggett.github.io/tropy-static-iiif)
7. For now, choose *Tropy Generic* in `Item Template` to use the default mapping of metadata.
8. Highlight all your works and click *File > Export* and the value you entered in the `Name` field in step four above.
9. Choose where you want to export your files on your machine.

    It is possible to modify metadata templates to work with Tropiiify. See the [Tropiiify docs](https://github.com/arkalab/tropiiify) for more details.
</Callout>

### Add Your Files to to GitHub

Now that we have all your images, image server responses, manifests, and collection, we need to get them
into your GitHub repository. There are many ways to approach this, but one easy solution is:

1. On the command line, add and commit with git all the files you just exported.  The export stores all files in a directory called `iiif`. Make sure the root of your repository is this and not its parent that you exported it into.GitHub
2. Push your existing repository by copying and pasting all the instructions beneathe **…or push an existing repository from the command line** in your GitHub repository to the command line and press "Return".

### Enable the Repository to be your Image Server

Now that you have a repository with all your data, we need to configure it so that it will function as an image
server.

* In your new GitHub repository, click the **Settings** button.
* Click the **Pages** tab.
* Under **Build and deployment**, select **deploy from a branch**
* Under **Branch**, make sure it is set to ‘main’ and ‘/(root)’
* Click save.

<Callout type="info">
    Github repos have a maximum file size of 5GB.  If you exceed this amount, you can add additional repositories
    to serve sections of your site.
</Callout>

###  Setup Your Canopy Project to Use This Collection

Now that all your files are ready, we can setup a new Canopy project to use them.  To do that:

* Follow the instructions in [this guide](https://canopy-iiif.github.io/docs/deploy-to-github-pages) to set up a new Canopy site in GitHub Pages.
* In your `config/canopy.json`file in your new Canopy instance, set the `collection` value to `https://{GitHubAccount}.github.io/{RepositoryYouCreatedInStep1}/index.json`

```json {2-3}
{
  "collection": "https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-tropy-example/index.json",
  "devCollection": "https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-tropy-example/index.json",
  "metadata": ["Date"],
  "label": { "none": ["Tropiiify Example Site"] },
  "summary": {
    "none": ["An Example Site using Tropiiify"]
  },
  "theme": {
    "defaultTheme": "light",
    "accentColor": "red",
    "grayColor": "mauve",
    "radius": "small",
    "scaling": "100%"
  }
}
```

* The site will now build and be available online at the address described in step 5 of the **Deploy to GitHub Pages**  guide in 5 to 10 minutes.
