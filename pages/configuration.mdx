# Configuration

The Canopy IIIF build process is configured at `config/canopy.json` if it exists. If this configuration file has not been created, the default configuration `config/.default/canopy.default.json` will be used as a fallback for demonstration purposes.

<Callout type="info">
  See the **[Create a Project guide](/get-started)** for a step-by-step guide
  illustrating the setup of Canopy IIIF project.
</Callout>

## Configuration options

Canopy IIIF is a highly configurable application that can be tailored to the needs of a project. Canopy configurations fallback to default settings if not customized.

## Properties

A custom Canopy configuration is created at `config/canopy.json`. The file must be a valid JSON and contain a `collection` property with a valid IIIF Collection URI.

| Property        | Type            | Description                            |
| --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `collection`    | `string`        | IIIF Collection URI                    |
| `devCollection` | `string`        | IIIF Collection URI                    |
| `label`         | `label `        | IIIF Presentation 3.0 label property   |
| `summary`       | `summary`       | IIIF Presentation 3.0 summary property |
| `featured`      | `Array<string>` | Array of IIIF Manifest URIs            |
| `metadata`      | `Array<string>` | Array of `metadata` labels             |

### collection

The `collection` property is **required** and must be the URI of the referenced source IIIF Collection and must match the `id` of this resource. Collections referencing other Collections in their `items` property are not currently supported.

```json
"collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a?as=iiif&size=500"
```

### devCollection

The `devCollection` property is an optional property used only when running the development server using `npm run dev`. Like `collection`, it must be the URI of the referenced source IIIF Collection and must match the `id` of this resource. The `devCollection` property is useful when working with a large IIIF Collection and you want to target a smaller subset of the collection for development purposes.

```json
"devCollection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a?as=iiif&size=25"
```

### label _and_ summary

The Canopy IIIF site **title** and **description** respectively default to the `label` and `summary` (if set) IIIF Presentation API properties of the source IIIF Collection resource. You can optionally override these values by providing valid Presentation 3.0 [label](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#label) and [summary](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/#summary) properties. These values are transformed to meta elements in the `<head>` of the HTML document.

```json
"label": {
  "none": ["Maps of Africa, 1561-1908"]
},
"summary": {
  "none": [
    "113 antique maps of Africa and accompanying text dating from the mid-16th Century to the early 20th Century."
  ]
}
```

### featured

You can inform Canopy IIIF of featured Manifests by providing an array of Manifest URIs matching the `id` value of resources in your source IIIF Collection. These must be referenced within the source IIIF Collection resource and the Manifest URIs must be an exact string match. These Manifests will render throughout the interface in featured components.

**Warning:** In the current release, featured Manifests must have an Image body on the first Canvas.

```json
"featured": [
  "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/24395a20-5054-4ad1-8dd8-04a230f4740b?as=iiif",
  "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0792fb69-efc3-4793-90e0-97362c67ac0e?as=iiif"
]
```

### metadata

Curating Metadata allows implementers of Canopy IIIF to select metadata fields that provide additional access points to end users. The fields can be specified by listing the labels of each metadata property found in the `metadata` property of the manifest. Metadata labels that are curated will be automatically included as featured elements on the homepage, the metadata page, linking from works, and as facets on the search page. An optimal case is a label common to all or most manifests with some in diversity of values across those resources.

**Note:** Metadata labels are not yet BCP 47 language code aware; however, aggregation processes will make exact string comparisons regardless of language code.

```json
"metadata": ["Subject", "Date", "Language", "Creator", "Publisher"]
```

## Example configuration

The following is an example configuration for the [16th-Early 20th Century Maps of Africa](https://dc.library.northwestern.edu/search?collection=16th-Early%2020th%20Century%20Maps%20of%20Africa) provided by Northwestern University Libraries.

- A `devCollection` value is provided to target a smaller subset of 15 items for development purposes.
- Two Manifests are `featured` and five `metadata` labels are curated.
- The `label` and `summary` properties are overridden to provide custom values for the site title and description.

```json copy filename="config/canopy.json"
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a?as=iiif&size=500",
  "devCollection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a?as=iiif&size=25",
  "featured": [
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/24395a20-5054-4ad1-8dd8-04a230f4740b?as=iiif",
    "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/works/0792fb69-efc3-4793-90e0-97362c67ac0e?as=iiif"
  ],
  "metadata": ["Subject", "Date", "Language", "Creator", "Publisher"],
  "label": {
    "none": ["Maps of Africa, 1561-1908"]
  },
  "summary": {
    "none": [
      "113 antique maps of Africa and accompanying text dating from the mid-16th Century to the early 20th Century."
    ]
  }
}
```

## Minimal configuration

The following is a minimal configuration for Canopy IIIF. This is a valid configuration intended for experimentatal and demonstration purposes, however, it is not recommended for production use.

```json copy filename="config/canopy.json"
{
  "collection": "https://api.dc.library.northwestern.edu/api/v2/collections/1c2e2200-c12d-4c7f-8b87-a935c349898a?as=iiif&size=500"
}
```
