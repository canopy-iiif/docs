{"/about":{"title":"About","data":{"":"The project name \"Canopy\" is inspired by the tree motiff in the presentation, A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure, delivered by María Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and Esmé Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting. Following this infrastructure vision, Canopy was created as a front end solution for rapid and easy creation of static sites using a IIIF Collection and its Manifests.Canopy IIIF is created using Next.js 13, with a FlexSearch index for text search, IIIF Presentation API 3.0 delivering resource content, Radix UI and Stitches used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from IIIF Commons and Samvera supporting the work presentation and resource delivery.","origination#Origination":"Canopy was initially conceived at the University of Tennessee Libraries in the Summer '21 as a statically generated web application for the Rising from the Ashes: The Chimney Tops 2 Wildfires Oral History Project. This project was generated from a single IIIF Collection; however, the components delivering the user interface became heavily tailored to the source material of the Rising from the Ashes project, thus limiting the reuse of the codebase for other collections. The original Canopy featured a heavily integrated IIIF A/V Viewer designed to deliver Sound and Video resources. This A/V viewer would eventually evolve into a partial inspiration for Clover IIIF.Canopy was reimagined as Canopy IIIF in early Winter '22 with the primary focus of the project maintaining the the ability to build an interoperable site from any IIIF Collection following IIIF Presentation API 2.0 and 3.0 specifications.","contributors#Contributors":"Creators\nMat Jordan - Northwestern University\nLibraries, formerly University of Tennessee Libraries\nMark Baggett - University of Tennessee\nLibraries\nAdam Arling - Northwestern University\nLibraries\nAdditional Credits\nEmily Gore - University of Georgia Libraries, formerly University of Tennessee\nLibraries\nDavid Schober - Northwestern University Libraries\nMartim Passos - Instituto Moreira Salles\nTarje Lavik - University of Bergen Library"}},"/configuration":{"title":"Configuration","data":{}},"/configuration/basic":{"title":"Basic Canopy IIIF Configuration","data":{"":"The Canopy IIIF build process will read from a custom configuration file at config/canopy.json if it exists.

Using a IIIF\nCollection as a data\nsource, Canopy IIIF generates a browseable and searchable static site and\nprovides a straightforward solution using Markdown for adding scholary context\nto the resources that are referenced.\nScholarship\nResearchers can curate and aggregate content from various providers and\nadd their own context to resources\nExhibits\nLibraries, museums, and archives can create digital exhibits from the\nworks in their repositories\nMinimal infrastructure\nSmall-scale, headless infrastructure for institutions with limited\nresources to build their own digital collections application\nFeatures\nCanopy IIIF extends the features of Next.js to produce a full-text search\nindex using FlexSearch, provides support for both IIIF Presentation API\n2.x and 3.0 specifications, and automatically generates facets based on\nthe curated metadata labels and values found within Manifests. The\nplatform’s API routes return IIIF collections and allow for users to\nreference IIIF resources internally and externally. In addition to these\nfeatures, the product roadmap and planned features include expanding\ninternationalization support, generating interactive maps and timelines\nbased on the presence of navPlace and navDate properties, and leveraging\nIIIF Content State and Change Discovery APIs."}}}
