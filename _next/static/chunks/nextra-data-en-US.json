{"/about":{"title":"About","data":{"":"The project name \"Canopy\" is inspired by the tree motiff in the presentation, A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure, delivered by María Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and Esmé Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting. Following this infrastructure vision, Canopy was created as a front end solution for rapid and easy creation of static sites using a IIIF Collection and its Manifests.Canopy IIIF is created using Next.js 13, with a FlexSearch index for text search, IIIF Presentation API 3.0 delivering resource content, Radix UI and Stitches used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from IIIF Commons and Samvera supporting the work presentation and resource delivery.","origination#Origination":"Canopy was initially conceived at the University of Tennessee Libraries in the Summer '21 as a statically generated web application for the Rising from the Ashes: The Chimney Tops 2 Wildfires Oral History Project. This project was generated from a single IIIF Collection; however, the components delivering the user interface became heavily tailored to the source material of the Rising from the Ashes project, thus limiting the reuse of the codebase for other collections. The original Canopy featured a heavily integrated IIIF A/V Viewer designed to deliver Sound and Video resources. This A/V viewer would eventually evolve into a partial inspiration for Clover IIIF.Canopy was reimagined as Canopy IIIF in early Winter '22 with the primary focus of the project maintaining the the ability to build an interoperable site from any IIIF Collection following IIIF Presentation API 2.0 and 3.0 specifications.","contributors#Contributors":"Creators\nMat Jordan - Northwestern University\nLibraries, formerly University of Tennessee Libraries\nMark Baggett - University of Tennessee\nLibraries\nAdam Arling - Northwestern University\nLibraries\nAdditional Credits\nEmily Gore - University of Georgia Libraries, formerly University of Tennessee\nLibraries\nDavid Schober - Northwestern University Libraries\nMartim Passos - Instituto Moreira Salles\nTarje Lavik - University of Bergen Library"}},"/configuration":{"title":"Configuration","data":{"":"The Canopy IIIF build process is configured at config/canopy.json if it exists.

As\nthe nation grappled with the devastating aftermath of the war, the U.S. government recognized the need to support the\nveterans who had sacrificed their well-being for the Union or the Confederacy. War pensions, providing financial\nassistance and support to disabled veterans, widows, and orphans, became a cornerstone of the post-war social contract.\nThe Pension Acts of 1862 and 1864 marked significant legislative milestones, establishing the framework for compensating\nsoldiers and their families for injuries, disabilities, and loss of life incurred during the conflict. These early\npension initiatives laid the foundation for the more comprehensive pension system that would evolve in subsequent\ndecades, reflecting the government's commitment to honoring and caring for those who bore the burdens of the Civil War.\n## Explore Works Related to War Pensions\n<Slider iiifContent=\"/api/facet/subject/war-pensions.json\" />\nRead more about creating custom content in the Create Markdown Content\nGuide."}},"/configuration/theme":{"title":"Theme","data":{"":"Implementers may choose to modify the theme settings of their Canopy IIIF project.
