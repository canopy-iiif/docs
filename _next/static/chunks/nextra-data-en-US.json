{"/about":{"title":"About","data":{"":"The project name \"Canopy\" is inspired by the tree motiff in the presentation, A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure, delivered by MarÃ­a Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and EsmÃ© Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting. Following this infrastructure vision, Canopy was created as a front end solution for rapid and easy creation of static sites using a IIIF Collection and its Manifests.Canopy IIIF is created using Next.js 13, with a FlexSearch index for text search, IIIF Presentation API 3.0 delivering resource content, Radix UI and Stitches used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from IIIF Commons and Samvera supporting the work presentation and resource delivery.","origination#Origination":"Canopy was initially conceived at the University of Tennessee Libraries in the Summer '21 as a statically generated web application for the Rising from the Ashes: The Chimney Tops 2 Wildfires Oral History Project. This project was generated from a single IIIF Collection; however, the components delivering the user interface became heavily tailored to the source material of the Rising from the Ashes project, thus limiting the reuse of the codebase for other collections. The original Canopy featured a heavily integrated IIIF A/V Viewer designed to deliver Sound and Video resources. This A/V viewer would eventually evolve into a partial inspiration for Clover IIIF.Canopy was reimagined as Canopy IIIF in early Winter '22 with the primary focus of the project maintaining the the ability to build an interoperable site from any IIIF Collection following IIIF Presentation API 2.0 and 3.0 specifications.","contributors#Contributors":"Creators\nMat Jordan - \nNorthwestern University Libraries, formerly University of Tennessee Libraries\nMark Baggett - \nUniversity of Tennessee Libraries\nAdam Arling - \nNorthwestern University Libraries\nAdditional Credits\nEmily Gore - \nUniversity of Georgia Libraries, formerly University of Tennessee Libraries\nDavid Schober -\nNorthwestern University Libraries\nMartim Passos - \nInstituto Moreira Salles\nTarje Lavik - \nUniversity of Bergen Library"}},"/docs/content":{"title":"Content","data":{}},"/docs/content/components":{"title":"Components","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/card":{"title":"Card","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/hero":{"title":"Hero","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/map":{"title":"Map","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/scroll":{"title":"Scroll","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/slider":{"title":"Slider","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/timeline":{"title":"Timeline","data":{}},"/docs/content/components/viewer":{"title":"Viewer","data":{}},"/docs/content/layout":{"title":"Layout","data":{}},"/docs/content/markdown":{"title":"Markdown","data":{}},"/docs/content/navigation":{"title":"Navigation","data":{}},"/docs/customize":{"title":"Customize","data":{}},"/docs/customize/featured":{"title":"Featured","data":{}},"/docs/customize/locale":{"title":"Locale","data":{}},"/docs/customize/metadata":{"title":"Metadata","data":{}},"/docs/customize/search":{"title":"Search","data":{}},"/docs/customize/theme":{"title":"Theme","data":{}},"/docs/customize/viewer":{"title":"Viewer","data":{}},"/docs/deploy":{"title":"Deploy","data":{"":"Canopy-IIIF can be easily deployed to GitHub pages or any JAMstack hosting service.The following sections will guide you through the process of deploying Canopy-IIIF to a few of these options.\nDeploying to GitHub Pages\nDeploying to Vercel"}},"/docs/deploy/github":{"title":"GitHub","data":{"":"Hosting on GitHub Pages can be done easily\nin just a few steps.\nClick the \"Use this template\" button at the top of the Canopy-IIIF\nrepository to create a new repository based on this template.

This allows the GitHub\nworkflow to run and the static Canopy output to be deployed to a new branch.\nNext, modify the .github/workflows/gh-pages.deploy.yml file in repository for the NEXT_PUBLIC_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH\nto be relative to the new repository. After changing these settings, commit your change and trigger the action to run.\nOnce the action has run, the action indicator should change from a red X to a green check mark and a new branch called\ngh-pages will be created.\nOnce the gh-pages branch exists and the action indicator is a green check mark, again press the Settings button.\nUnder Code and automation, click Pages and select gh-pages from the Branch dropdown under Build and deployment\nand click *Save.
