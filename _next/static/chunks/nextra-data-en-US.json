{"/about":{"title":"About","data":{"":"The project name \"Canopy\" is inspired by the tree motiff in the presentation, A Tree's Strength Is Its Trunk: IIIF as Central Operational Infrastructure, delivered by M.A. Matienzo (formerly Stanford University Libraries) and Esm√© Cowles (Princeton University Library) at the CNI Fall 2020 Virtual Membership Meeting. Following this infrastructure vision, Canopy was created as a front end solution for rapid and easy creation of static sites using a IIIF Collection and its Manifests.Canopy IIIF is created using Next.js 13, with a FlexSearch index for text search, IIIF Presentation API 3.0 delivering resource content, Radix UI and Stitches used throughout for the user interface, and various community modules from IIIF Commons and Samvera supporting the work presentation and resource delivery.","origination#Origination":"Canopy was initially conceived at the University of Tennessee Libraries in the Summer '21 as a statically generated web application for the Rising from the Ashes: The Chimney Tops 2 Wildfires Oral History Project. This project was generated from a single IIIF Collection; however, the components delivering the user interface became heavily tailored to the source material of the Rising from the Ashes project, thus limiting the reuse of the codebase for other collections. The original Canopy featured a heavily integrated IIIF A/V Viewer designed to deliver Sound and Video resources. This A/V viewer would eventually evolve into a partial inspiration for Clover IIIF.Canopy was reimagined as Canopy IIIF in early Winter '22 with the primary focus of the project maintaining the the ability to build an interoperable site from any IIIF Collection following IIIF Presentation API 2.0 and 3.0 specifications.","contributors#Contributors":"Creators\nMat Jordan - Northwestern University\nLibraries, formerly University of Tennessee Libraries\nMark Baggett - University of Tennessee\nLibraries\nAdam Arling - Northwestern University\nLibraries\nAdditional Credits\nEmily Gore - University of Georgia Libraries, formerly University of Tennessee\nLibraries\nDavid Schober - Northwestern University Libraries\nMartim Passos - Instituto Moreira Salles\nTarje Lavik - University of Bergen Library"}},"/configuration":{"title":"Configuration","data":{"":"The Canopy IIIF build process is configured at config/canopy.json if it exists.

The metadata property is an array of metadata labels that\nmatch string values in your Manifest URI metadata entries.Since you need a Collection for the Subject label with value of \"War pensions\", you need to add the label to your\nmetadata array if it's not already there.\n{\n  \"collection\": \"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/tdh\",\n  \"metadata\": [\"Subject\", \"Place\", \"Format\", \"Date\"]\n}","validate-that-the-collection-was-generated#Validate that the Collection was Generated":"If you have defined NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH in your .env file, you will need\nto include that pattern in your URI.\nIIIF Collections are generated when your site is rebuilt or when your server is restarted. After you've added the\nmetadata label to your config/canopy.json file, you should make sure your collection exists. If you are working\ndirectly in GitHub with GitHub Pages, you can commit the change and wait for the site to rebuild. If you are working\nlocally, you will need to stop your local server:ctrl + c and then npm run dev to restart your local server.Once your site is running, you can check that the IIIF Collection was generated by visiting the Collection URI in your\nbrowser. Canopy uses the slugify package when generating IIIF Collections. In\nthis process, both the metadata label and metadata value are slugified to create the route to you collection. Slugifying\nis beneficial for search engine optimization and readability.The pattern for the URI for your Collection will be your site's base path followed by /api/facet/${facet.slug}/${value.slug}.json.\nIn this example, the Collection URI would be /api/facet/subject/war-pensions.json.","add-the-collection-to-your-custom-content#Add the Collection to your Custom Content":"Now that you have confirmed the generated Collection is available, you can add it to your custom content. Let's say\nyou want to use the Collection in a Slider component on a custom content page called history in the about section\nof your site. You would create or modify the file according to the Create Markdown Content Guide\nand add the Slider component where you want it to appear on the page with your Collection URI as the value of the\niiifContent attribute.\n---\ntitle: History\nnavigation: \"about\"\n---\n# War Pensions\nDuring the American Civil War, the issue of war pensions emerged as a crucial aspect of post-conflict reconstruction. As\nthe nation grappled with the devastating aftermath of the war, the U.S. government recognized the need to support the\nveterans who had sacrificed their well-being for the Union or the Confederacy. War pensions, providing financial\nassistance and support to disabled veterans, widows, and orphans, became a cornerstone of the post-war social contract.\nThe Pension Acts of 1862 and 1864 marked significant legislative milestones, establishing the framework for compensating\nsoldiers and their families for injuries, disabilities, and loss of life incurred during the conflict. These early\npension initiatives laid the foundation for the more comprehensive pension system that would evolve in subsequent\ndecades, reflecting the government's commitment to honoring and caring for those who bore the burdens of the Civil War.\n## Explore Works Related to War Pensions\n<Slider iiifContent=\"/api/facet/subject/war-pensions.json\" />\nRead more about creating custom content in the Create Markdown Content\nGuide."}},"/configuration/theme":{"title":"Theme","data":{"":"Implementers may choose to modify the theme settings of their Canopy IIIF project.As of v0.12.0, Canopy now utilizes Radix UI Themes, allowing implementers to customize Colors, Scaling, and Radius styling.Users may also set the default \"mode\" as defaultTheme, options include light, dark, or system.
